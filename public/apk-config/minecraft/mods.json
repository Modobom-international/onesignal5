Lots of zombies will spawn during the daytime and occasionally a zombie pigman will spawn as well in the Overworld. Find out if you have what it takes to survive in a zombie apocalypse.\n\n# Features\n\nâ€¢ Lots of zombies spawn during the day, and occasionally zombie pigmen spawn as well. Itâ€™s extremely challenging according to Sirconol.\nâ€¢ Zombies do not burn during the day. However, they do have both less health and attack damage.\nâ€¢ Husks spawn rarely during the day. Husks also drop bows since spiders spawn less frequently.\nâ€¢ Witches will now throw potions and summon skeletons. Skeletons do not burn in the day and use their former comrades as weapons. These witches played with magic they do not understand and are suffering the consequences. Their necromancy experiments started the apocalypse, yet they still do necromancy.\nâ€¢ Deserts are almost entirely zombie free. And different biomes have different amounts of zombies spawning.\nâ€¢ The night is more safe than during the day. Much less zombies spawn during the night. So sleeping is a catch 22. Do you want the grace period or do you want to set your spawn?\nâ€¢ Strays melee attack and walks slower.\nâ€¢ Skeletons are faster.\n\n# Known Issue\n\nLag. After doing /kill @e a few times the amount of drops would lag their device. The device was of a low end model so if you have a low end device keep this in mind (iPad mini 2).\n\n# How to install\n\nâ€¢ Download and install the behavior pack\nâ€¢ Activate the behavior pack in your world settings\n"

This applies for all hostile mobs, even ones which arenâ€™t a direct threat to the player.\nâ€¢ The Archer (replaces skeletons) is armed with a bow. They look completely different to a skeleton but their behaviors are fairly similar (except that they are friendly toward players).\nâ€¢ The Caster (replaces strays) is a magician who have the ability to shoot shulker projectiles at hostile mobs.\nâ€¢ The Warrior (replaces wither skeletons) is the strongest human.

At this point it only includes a couple of recipes but more will hopefully be added in the next addon update.\n\nâ€¢ Crafting Table Recipe Book: Work in progress, more recipes need to be added\nâ€¢ Furnace Recipe Book: Includes all recipes\nâ€¢ Inventory Recipe Book: Work in progress\n\n# How to activate it\n\nâ€¢ Download and install the resource pack\nâ€¢ Activate the pack you installed in Settings (Settings > Global resources)\n"

And masks, armors, weapons, and items added.\nIf you are a fan of tokyo ghoul, it is the perfect add-on for you!\n\n# Characters\n\nâ€¢ Zombie, Stray : Kaneki Ken\nâ€¢ Villagers : Kaneki, Hide, Touka, Hinami\nâ€¢ Witch : Touka\nâ€¢ Creeper : Amon (can be tamed with diamond)\nâ€¢ Skeleton : Uta\nâ€¢ Wither Skeleton : Jason\nâ€¢ Zombie Pigman : Shuu Tsukiyama\nâ€¢ Iron Golem : Ayato\nâ€¢ Enderman : Rize\nâ€¢ Creeper : Amon\nâ€¢ Husk : Hinami\n\n# Items\n\nâ€¢ Masks & Armors\nâ€¢ Weapons\nâ€¢ Foods\n\nAnd much more, I hope you enjoy it.\n"

He will show no mercy for villagers, players, cows, chickens, iron golems and pigs which he will attempt to slay.\n\nDuring the day he is disguised as a sheep and wonâ€™t do anyone any harm. But when night comes he will immediately turn into the Grim Reaper.\n\nThe Grim Reaper has lots of health and he deals quite some damage as well.

Thereâ€™s a downside to it and that is that it replaces items such as the fishing rod.\n\n# What different balls are there?\n\nThere are 7 different balls and each of them has unique powers.\n\nâ€¢ Freezing Ball (Fishing Rod): Freezes the enemy for a couple of seconds.\nâ€¢ Explosive Ball (Eye of Ender): Causes a huge explosion and lots of fire.\nâ€¢ Health Ball (Snowball): Heals the target(s) instantly. Works on both mobs and players. Lingers on the ground for several seconds.\nâ€¢ Levitation Ball (Bottle oâ€™ Enchanting): Causes the mob or players to start levitating.\nâ€¢ Poisonous Ball (Ender Pearl): A linger potion effect which lingers for several seconds. Can cause damage to multiple mobs at the same time.\nâ€¢ TNT Ball (Bow): Spawns a primted TNT block.\nâ€¢ Lightning Ball (Egg): Summons lightning bolts.\n\nLetâ€™s have a look at some of the magic wizard balls. In the first image you can see what happened right after I threw an Explosive Ball.\n\nThe Health Ball is really useful in case you need to heal a large group of players (or mobs) at the same time. You can return to it later too as it lingers for a long time.\n\nThe Levitation Ball can be used as a weapon to quickly subdue a monster or a player. It can also be used on yourself if you need to get past some type of obstacles.\n\nThe Poisonous Ball causes a lingering potion effect which lasts for several seconds. Any mob or player which steps into the green ring will be poisoned.\n\nThe Lightning Ball can be used for summoning a lightning bolt. It inflicts some damage as well as sets the ground, mob or player on fire."

But itâ€™s really more like a sniper rifle. It one-shots most enemies.\n\n[Machine Gun] (Snowball)\nArmed with this weapon you can take out most gangs of monsters. Spray them and they will die immediately.\n\n[Grenade] (Egg)\nFire in the hole! The range of this throwable explosive is awesome. Itâ€™s perfect if you need to do great damage to lots of mobs at the same time.\n\n[Atomic Bomb] (TNT)\nItâ€™s by no means comparable to an atomic bomb in real life but itâ€™s definitely much more powerful than the ordinary TNT block. It causes much more damage and also sets things on fire."

For example, you can place down a turret (using a spawn egg) on different locations at your base. If the turret detects any type of hostile mob it will start firing wither heads.\n\n# How does it work?\nThree of the mobs in Minecraft have been replaced by turrets. A turret is basically a machine (or in this case a mob) which can be placed out on strategic positions. It will then automatically open fire at any hostile enemies which come too close to your base.\n\n[Wither Turret Max]\nThis is the most powerful turret which creates the most aerial damage. Itâ€™s recommended to have them stationed far away from your base seeing as they might accidentally destroy parts of your base while defending it.\n\nâ€¢ Replaces wither skeleton\nâ€¢ Shoots explosive wither heads (big explosions)\nâ€¢ Health: 150 hearts\nâ€¢ Attack radius/range: 70 blocks\n\n[Two-headed Wither Turret] \nThis turret kills individual targets fairly quickly. It will literally spray wither heads at its enemies and usually it should take no more than a few seconds to take down the target.\n\nâ€¢ Replaces stray\nâ€¢ Sprays wither heads (small explosions)\nâ€¢ Health: 150 hearts\nâ€¢ Attack radius/range: 70 blocks\n\n[Basic Wither Turret]\nThe following turret is the most easy to find seeing as it spawns in the Overworld (since it replaces skeletons). It fires wither heads at its enemies and itâ€™s not as efficient as the other turrets in terms of reloading.\n\nâ€¢ Replaces skeleton\nâ€¢ Shoots wither heads (small explosions)\nâ€¢ Health: 150 hearts\nâ€¢ Attack radius/range: 70 blocks"

Itâ€™s a kind of cruel way to treat an animal but maybe itâ€™s more ethical than killing it to get some leather.\n\nWolves are now a little bit larger than before. As itâ€™s a little bit stronger it will now be able to carry one rider. If you attack a mob (or if you are being attacked by an animal) it will help kill that mob (or protect you against hostile ones).\n\nHold cooked mutton or raw mutton in your hand to control the direction.\n\nEven though you can now ride the wolf it still works just the same as before.

This mod adds a flintlock pistol to the game. It actually replaces the fishing pole so this means you canâ€™t use a fishing pole while using this addon.\n\nHow to get the weapon?\nYou can purchase flintlock pistols from villagers. The Flintlock Pistol replaces the fishing pole.\n\niOS / Android: Hold an emerald, long press on a villager and press Buy Pistol\nWindows 10: Right-click on a villager while holding an emerald\n\nTo use the weapon you simply need to equip it and then press the Shoot button on the screen. When I tested this it read â€œFishâ€ but it will likely be fixed in an upcoming update for this addon.\n\nAs this is a long range weapon you donâ€™t necessarily have to get this close to an enemy to shoot it.\n\nThere is no aiming crosshair so to make sure that you hit the target just make sure it is somewhere in the center of the screen. Each hit equals 5 attack damage."

Here is a great addon for anyone who is a fan of Naruto or just ninjas in general. It replaces a multitude of mobs, weapons and armors. Itâ€™s currently quite simple in terms of custom features but hopefully that can improve over time.\n\n[Weapons]\n\nThe following weapons are dropped by mobs when they are killed.\n\nâ€¢ Narutoâ€™s Awesome Move (Bow) â€“ Explosive high damage\nâ€¢ Explosive Kunai (Egg) â€“ Explosive, huge area of effect\nâ€¢ Kunai (Snowball) â€“ Deals a lot of damage\nâ€¢ Shuriken (Ender Pearl) â€“ Deals more damage than the Kunai, dropped by endermen and skeletons\nâ€¢ Demon Wind Shuriken (Fishing Rod) â€“ Bigger shuriken, one hits most mobs\nâ€¢ Sasukeâ€™s Sword (Diamond Sword) â€“ Thin but strong blade\nâ€¢ Samehada â€“ Kisameâ€™s Sword (Stone Sword) â€“ Wielded by Kisame\nâ€¢ Cleaver Sword (Golden Sword)\nâ€¢ Combat Kunai (Wooden Sword) â€“ Ninja sword\nâ€¢ Shinobi Katana (Iron Sword) â€“ Also a type of ninja sword\n\n[Mobs]\n\nThere are 7 new mobs in Minecraft. Since most of them are dangerous and have the ability to live both during the day and night itâ€™s obvious that the game will get a bit more difficult. But at the same time you got some really nice weapons to help you out.\n\nâ€¢ Itachi (Zombie Pigman) â€“ Strong\nâ€¢ B Class Enemy Ninjas (Skeleton) â€“ Some type of ninja which uses chakra skills on you\nâ€¢ Konan (Stray) â€“ Uses chakra skills on you\nâ€¢ Kisame (Wither Skeleton) â€“ Wields a sword\nâ€¢ Zetsu Clone (Husk) â€“ Very dangerous mob, deals a lot of damage\nâ€¢ A Class Enemy Shinobi (Zombie) â€“ Found both during the day and night, dangerous\nâ€¢ S Class Enemy Shinobi (Zombie Villager) â€“ More rare than the above, but they are also the strongest of all ninjas/shinobis\n\n[Armor]\n\nThe armor sets are replaced with a few different Naruto armors (or clothing). The armor sets donâ€™t have any special abilities yet (due to addon limitations).\n\nâ€¢ Jounin Armor (Diamond Armor)\nâ€¢ Akatasuki Clothing (Gold Armor)\nâ€¢ Narutoâ€™s Jacket and Clothes (Iron Armor)"

Use this resource pack if you want to add some colors to your next creations!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nType the following text command to spawn any of the following blocks found in the list further down: /setblock ~ ~ ~ &lt;type&gt; &lt;id&gt;\n\nDirt (ID: 1 â€“ 13)\nStone (ID: 8 â€“ 15)\nPlanks (ID: 7 â€“ 14)\nFence (ID: 6 â€“ 14)\nStained Glass (ID: 0 â€“ 15)\nStained Glass Panels (ID: 0 â€“ 15)\nLetâ€™s say you wanted to spawn a green Oak Wood Planks block then you would need to type the following command: /setblock ~ ~ ~ planks 6\n\nEven though itâ€™s only possible to use the blocks by using the setblock command itâ€™s still pretty cool as you can use it to add some colors to your creations."

    "text": "This addon changes the behavior and textures for 7 different items to make them more useful for hunting. For example, the bow will be turned into an old fashioned pistol and the arrows are turned into bullets. Youâ€™ll also be able to throw a new explosive item known as a dynamite. If you are looking to upgrade some of the weapons in Minecraft Pocket Edition then this mod is a perfect solution for that.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach new weapon and item replace some of the default items. Here is a list of the new weapons and the ones they replace:\n\nâ€¢ Pistol = Bow\nâ€¢ Bullet = Arrow\nâ€¢ Wooden Stick = Wooden Sword\nâ€¢ Big Sword = Diamond Sword\nâ€¢ Machete = Gold Sword\nâ€¢ Knife = Stone Sword\nâ€¢ Dynamite = Snowball\n\nAlso the textures look quite a bit different than before. I wonâ€™t showcase the swords as they are basically the same besides the new textures.\n\nThe pistol (also known as bow) has a much greater range than before. You can stand very far away from a mob but still get a good aim and good hit precision. The sound of the weapon is also different to really make it sound as if you were firing a gun.\n\nThe dynamite (also known as snowball) is probably one of the funniest items to use. Itâ€™ll explode and cause a minor fire. In the image down below I threw a bunch of them and caused a forest fire.\n\nItâ€™s probably a little bit too dangerous to play around with anywhere close to your important creations, so be careful."

Type the following text command to give paintballs to all players: /give @a snowball 300 0\n\nSplit up into four different teams: blue, green, red and yellow and then enter the map.\nType /spawnpoint and then make a countdown from 5 before dropping down into the arena.\nAs soon as you enter the paintball arena the battle begins. The winner is the last player (or team) alive.\n\nYou can also play this map King of the Ladder style. Use the same instructions as above but give also players enchanted golden apples.\n\nThe objective for a King of the Ladder type of gameplay is to get to the highest platform and stay there for the longest time during a period of five minutes."
