    "description": "AK47s, rocket launchers, grenades and glocks are just few of the existing guns in what today is the most advanced weapons mod for Minecraft PE.\nDesnoGuns comes with a custom user interface for each weapon and an advanced weapon system including things like ammunitions and unique crafting recipes for each weapon.\n\nMore than 40 weapons are included in the mod. Everything from handguns to massive rocket launchers and handheld throwable items like grenades and molotovs.\nHow to get a weapon and use it?\nFirst of you need to craft a weapon. Most of the weapons are crafted with redstone, iron ingots and gunpowder and the specific ammo based on what weapon you want to craft.\n\nDifferent weapons use different user interfaces. For example, with one button on each side of the screen you can choose whether to shoot or to aim.

    "description": "PokeCraft is a promising Pokémon mod which is exclusively being created for Minecraft Pocket Edition. This version is an early beta and includes features such as 20+ Pokémon, catch and release system and randomly generated structures. If you want to turn your Minecraft world into the universe of Pokémon then you need to give this one a try.\nGetting Started\nBefore getting started we highly recommend to download and use one of the Pokémon player skins to really make it look as if you were playing a Pokémon game.\nThere are currently more than 20 different Pokémon and they spawn naturally in different biomes throughout the world.\nThere features still quite limited at the moment. Right now you can only catch and spawn Pokémon.\n\nTo catch one begin by getting a poke ball from the creative inventory. Find a Pokémon which you want to catch then long press on the screen to through the poke ball and attempt the catch.\n\nThe catch rate is random and sometimes you are unlucky and have to redo it. In this case, I successfully managed to catch my Pokémon which was an Ivysaur. Dont forget to the pick up the poke ball.\nYou can catch up to 6 different Pokémon. The mod is using a slot system which can be accessed by the text chat.\n\nType any of the following commands in the text chat to manage your Pokémons:\n\nr = Release / Return Pokémon\ns0-5 (e.g. s1) = Select active slot\nd0-5 (e.g. d3) = Deletes the Pokémon in that slot\nIn the future you can expect a more slick user interface for this.\n\nAnyways, to summon a caught Pokémon type r in the chat.\nItem IDs\nThere are many more items than the ones listed here. However, since this is a beta version most of them have no features. Down below you will only find items which can be used in-game. For now, none of the items have crafting recipes.\n\nDelete Pokemon (2003)\nPoke Ball (1000)\nMaster Ball (1001)\nUltra Ball (1002)\nGreat Ball (1003)\nSafari Ball (1004)\nNet Ball (1005)\nLure Ball (1006)\nLevel Ball (1007)\nDive Ball (1008)\nMoon Ball (1009)\nNest Ball (1010)\nDusk Ball (1011)\nHeal Ball (1012)\nQuick Ball (1013)\nRepeat Ball (1014)\nTimer Ball (1015)\nLuxury Ball (1016)\nPremier Ball (1017)\nFast Ball (1018)\nFriend Ball (1019)\nCherish Ball (1020)\nLove Ball (1021)\nPark Ball (1022)\nSport Ball (1023)\nHeavy Ball (1024)",
