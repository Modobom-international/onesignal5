(you need to control it and will not move unless you ride it so that you don't lose it when you are away)\nTo control the movements of the dragon, you would require a bone, when you hold the bone by looking in any direction, the dragon moves in that direction. To move up, hold a blaze rod in your hand and the dragon would start to move up, to move down or land the dragon down, open up the dragon's inventory (that is normally opening the inventory when riding) and put the blaze rod in the given Special Slots (On the left side of the inventory marked with a saddle/horse icon)",
