    "description": "In this game, there are 7 different roles:\n\nWerewolf – Every night, they slit the throat of a villager. During the day they pretend to be villagers so as not to be discovered.\n\nGuard – Every night, he protects a player of his choice. He can’t protect himself twice in a row.\n\nHunter – The hunter, if he is killed by the Werewolves or lynch by the players, he has the power to retaliate by immediately killing any other player.\n\nCupid – The first night, he designates 2 players who will be madly in love with each other. If one of them dies, the other dies of grief immediately. A Werewolf and a Villager can be in love with each other. They then play against all the others, Werewolves and Villagers.\n\nWitch – She knows how to concoct two extremely powerful potions: A healing potion, to resurrect a player killed by Werewolves, a poisoning potion, used at night to eliminate a player. The witch must use each potion only once in the game.\n\nFortune-Teller – Every night, she knows the true personality of a player of her choice. She must help the Villagers, without being unmasked by the Werewolves.\n\nVillager – Doesn’t have any special skills, the player just has to be very intuitive.\n\nEach day, the surviving Villagers must lynch one of the players in the hope that he is a Werewolf.\n\nChangelog\n\nBugs fixed:\n- When the target killed by the Werewolves was protected by the guard, the witch could not heal it.\n- When a person left the game with a hunter and there were few survivors left, the hunter could not kill a person of his choice and the game was blocked.\n- The effects of the roles flashed\n-The Fortune-Teller couldn't know the role of a player\n-When a player left in the middle of the game and reconnected a moment later, the game glitched",
