    "description": "\nThis is a seed which features three temples. Two of the temples have been generated right next to each other which make them appear as one large building. More than thirty gold ingots can be found in all three temples chests. To find the massive temple (also known as a double temple) turn around once youve spawned and walk in that direction, crossing over the river to reach it. The first two temples are generated just next to each other making it look like one big temple. The treasures are hidden in a secret room. To find the secret room enter one of the temples can go to the center. Destroy the colored blocks in the center and you will find it. Just make sure you avoid the pressure plate as it will trigger a deadly TNT trap. A little further away from the massive temple is another temple. Its in that temple you will find most of the valuable gold treasures. In all three temples you will find the following treasures. Its a lot of gold and some diamonds, emeralds and iron ingots. 34 gold ingots 3 diamonds 4 emeralds 2 iron ingots 19 rotten flesh 36 bones\n",

Some of the houses are oddly generated as you will see in the images below. Here are the items which you will find in the blacksmith: 2 gold ingots 1 iron chestplate 1 bread 2 sap To your right there should be a big savannah mountain. Climb the mountain and then head straight forward and you should soon reach the second village. The most interesting part of the second village must be that there are quite a lot of farms.\n",

After just a bit of walking you will find the village. Its very easy to find so there shouldnt be any problems with that.
