The first thing you will notice are the impressive mountains surrounding the village youll spawn at. Nearby the village is also a swamp biome which gives the seed a mystic vibe, especially during the evening and night. In the village there is a blacksmith and in which you will find the following items in a chest: 2 emeralds 2 gold ingots 2 apples 1 iron helmet Heres a nice view of some the mountains. To get to the stronghold go to the well at the center of the village. Dig down beside it and you will soon see some mossed bricks and thats when youve found the strairwell which leads down to the stronghold.\n",

    "description": "\nJust a few times have we reviewed a couple of jungle village seeds before. And to be honest, neither of those are as good as this jungle village. The spawn is in the jungle under a tree and before you there are vines hanging down from the trees. Just a little further ahead you will see a farm and a couple of houses. Its admittedly not entirely located in the jungle. The other half of the village is in the desert where it probably was supposed to be generated. Either way, we must say that it looks really cool and unique. We counted a total of six structures (three farms and three houses) which are located in the jungle biome. The rest (and majority) of the total structures are in the desert.\n",

Turn slightly to your left at spawn so that you see a desert further ahead. Approach the desert and you will soon be able to see the triple village. It has many fun features, like the blacksmith which has been generated inside another building. In the blacksmiths chest you will find the following items: 4 gold ingots 3 iron ingots 1 iron leggings 2 ink sacks All in all it looks like many parts of the village is kind of messed up. Farms and houses have on several places been wrongly generated.\n",
