    "description": "There is no way to craft the new weapons but sometimes a Weapon Case item is dropped when killing mobs and you can use this item to retrieve a new sword. It’s really cool if you’re looking for a way to experience a whole bunch of new weapons in Minecraft. Just keep in mind that it’s a mod only available for Android devices.\nHow to get the new swords?\nThere are two different ways to obtain the new weapons.\n\nIf you want to do it in survival mode then you have to kill mobs until one of them drops a Weapon Case item. Hold the item in your and press the loot button to start the roulette game. Use the item again to choose a randomized weapon.\nThe other option is to obtain the swords in creative mode. Use the Search tab to search for “sword” and you will find all of the new swords listed there.\n",

Its a really clever idea which brings some more exploration opportunities to the Nether and now someone decided to create a mod adding this to the game.

Then tap on the either of the two bottom blocks with a flint and steel to open the portal.\nAs you arrive in the Nether it will take a quite bit of luck to find a Nether village. The chance of generation is very low and sometimes they will generate inside the mountains, thus making them difficult to find.\n\nThis is an early version of the mod and thats why the village is currently very small. It consists in fact of just one house and a farm.\nmportant: You will need the latest BlockLauncher beta for this to work!",

Then press the Dungeon button in the bottom left corner of the screen to open the dungeon settings tab. Here you can disable spawning for certain structures. Youll notice quickly that some structures spawn quite frequently. Thats why this option is really useful.\n\nThese settings are global.

You can use spawn eggs found in the creative inventory to more easily find them. If you want to obtain the spawn eggs in survival mode then we recommend downloading the X-Commands mod.\n\nAnother way to spawn them is by using a Chemical X on a pig, zombie, skeleton and so on. This will mutate the mob and turn them into a mutant! (Crafting recipes further down!)\n\nMob Battles\nOne thing which is really fun is to watch the mutants fight each other.

It has to be kept the same.\nYou can have multiple different small houses through your world. Each houses interior is generated far up in the sky above where it was placed. This means that you have to keep each small house separated by at least 10 blocks or so.",

    "description": "Creator: Fabiulu (original PC mod)\n\nThe Farlanders PE Mod adds more than 10 new Endermen, a new armor set, a bunch of new tools and much more. Its great for adventure and exploration as it adds new NPC structures which will spawn ranomly in the world. You can even tame one of the endermen and keep it as your minion. This is an early beta version so its still a work in progress. Even though all this its definitely worth to download!\n\nStructures\nEnder structures are randomly generated in the world. They are usually generated somewhere close to the player location. The custom structures sometimes include valuable things like hidden chests.\n\nOres\nThere is one new type of ore called Endumium Ore. To find it you will need a Wand Ore (ID: 489). Then find a stone block and tap on it with the wand. Next theres a 12.5% chance that it will transform into an Endumium Ore.

    "description": "Zombie World adds an apocalyptic feel to the world of Minecraft. Everywhere you turn there will be zombies and they are just as hostile during the day as they are during night. To survive this world of horror you must kill zombies to get the items needed to craft zombie-proof armor, night vision goggles and firearms.\nThis mod is entirely in Portuguese/Spanish but weve done our best to translate the names of things to English in this post.\n\nArmors\nOnce youve spawned zombies will randomly start to spawn. The world has quickly gone mad and the only ones who are surviving are those who can protect themselves. Choose from three different armors sets and plenty of weapons. In this case I decided togo with the Night Vision Goggles and a Bulletproof Vest.\n\nNight Vision Goggles (1700) : only creative inventory\nBulletproof Vest (1701) : only creative inventory\nPress the buttons on the right side of the screen to enable armor protection and night vision.\nThere is also an FBI armor set and a Modern Soldier armor set which you can use.

This version is an early beta and includes features such as 20+ Pokémon, catch and release system and randomly generated structures. If you want to turn your Minecraft world into the universe of Pokémon then you need to give this one a try.\nGetting Started\nBefore getting started we highly recommend to download and use one of the Pokémon player skins to really make it look as if you were playing a Pokémon game.\nThere are currently more than 20 different Pokémon and they spawn naturally in different biomes throughout the world.\nThere features still quite limited at the moment. Right now you can only catch and spawn Pokémon.\n\nTo catch one begin by getting a poke ball from the creative inventory. Find a Pokémon which you want to catch then long press on the screen to through the poke ball and attempt the catch.\n\nThe catch rate is random and sometimes you are unlucky and have to redo it. In this case, I successfully managed to catch my Pokémon which was an Ivysaur. Dont forget to the pick up the poke ball.\nYou can catch up to 6 different Pokémon. The mod is using a slot system which can be accessed by the text chat.\n\nType any of the following commands in the text chat to manage your Pokémons:\n\nr = Release / Return Pokémon\ns0-5 (e.g. s1) = Select active slot\nd0-5 (e.g. d3) = Deletes the Pokémon in that slot\nIn the future you can expect a more slick user interface for this.\n\nAnyways, to summon a caught Pokémon type r in the chat.\nItem IDs\nThere are many more items than the ones listed here. However, since this is a beta version most of them have no features. Down below you will only find items which can be used in-game. For now, none of the items have crafting recipes.\n\nDelete Pokemon (2003)\nPoke Ball (1000)\nMaster Ball (1001)\nUltra Ball (1002)\nGreat Ball (1003)\nSafari Ball (1004)\nNet Ball (1005)\nLure Ball (1006)\nLevel Ball (1007)\nDive Ball (1008)\nMoon Ball (1009)\nNest Ball (1010)\nDusk Ball (1011)\nHeal Ball (1012)\nQuick Ball (1013)\nRepeat Ball (1014)\nTimer Ball (1015)\nLuxury Ball (1016)\nPremier Ball (1017)\nFast Ball (1018)\nFriend Ball (1019)\nCherish Ball (1020)\nLove Ball (1021)\nPark Ball (1022)\nSport Ball (1023)\nHeavy Ball (1024)",

Its a really cute animal which looks kind of similar to an ostrich but its in fact originally an animal in the Final Fantasy game series.\n\nTaming\nChocobos can be found out in the wild, usually in forests. They make a really unique high-pitched sound so they are quite easy to track.\n\nOnce youve found one feed it with Gysahl greens to tame it. Gysahl is a leafy vegetable which can be found growing in the overworld in Minecraft. All crafting recipes and IDs can be found further down on this page!\nIf you successfully tame one you will see some hearts and it will also get a collar.\nRiding\nA tamed chocobo can be used for riding. Place a chocobo saddle on its back and then use an empty hand to straddle the chocobo. You can force it to jump by tapping on the ground. Press the jump button to get off and stop riding it.\nChocobo Pen\nBuild a pen for your chocobos to allow them someplace to rest and gain back their health. For a structure to be considered a pen it requires a roof and a floor of straw.\n\nTo find out health and other important information about your pet tap on it using a Chocopedia.\nBreeding\nTo breed two chocobos you will need two Loverly Gysahls (crafting recipes), one male and one female tamed Chocobo. (Use a Chocopedia to find out their sex.) Take them to a pen and then give them one Loverly Gysahl each.\nSoon after they will procreate and drop an egg on the ground.

He has much more health than an ordinary mob. It took us around 15 hits with a diamond sword to take him out.\nIf you do manage to kill the boss he will give you 200 experience points and 30 diamonds and 30 sand blocks will be added to your inventory.

If you are tired of going long distances just to place one single block then you can use this mod to throw the block wherever you want and have it placed there immediately.\n\nHow does it work?\nMake sure theres a block in your active/selected hotbar slot because its only then the THROW button appears on the screen. Look in the direction which you want the block thrown and then press the THROW button to throw it.\n\nIt takes quite a bit of practice before getting a hang of it. Aiming, in particular, is very difficult and not always very precise.\n\nHowever, when you do get good at it you can use the mod to build things quicker as it will allow you to place blocks further away than what otherwise would have been possible.\n\nWe recorded a short video to demonstate how it works and looks like in-game.",
