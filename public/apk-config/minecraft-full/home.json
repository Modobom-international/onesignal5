In all simplicity, it tells the story of a young ninja and his dreams of becoming the best and most knowledgeable ninja. Here is a great addon for anyone who is a fan of Naruto or just ninjas in general. It replaces a multitude of mobs, weapons and armors. Its currently quite simple in terms of custom features but hopefully that can improve over time.\n\nWeapons\nThe following weapons are dropped by mobs when they are killed.\n\nNarutos Awesome Move (Bow) : Explosive high damage\nExplosive Kunai (Egg) : Explosive, huge area of effect\nKunai (Snowball) : Deals a lot of damage\nShuriken (Ender Pearl) : Deals more damage than the Kunai, dropped by endermen and skeletons\nDemon Wind Shuriken (Fishing Rod) : Bigger shuriken, one hits most mobs\nSasukes Sword (Diamond Sword) : Thin but strong blade\nSamehada : Kisames Sword (Stone Sword) : Wielded by Kisame\nCleaver Sword (Golden Sword)\nCombat Kunai (Wooden Sword) : Ninja sword\nShinobi Katana (Iron Sword) : Also a type of ninja sword\n\nMobs\nThere are 7 new mobs in Minecraft. Since most of them are dangerous and have the ability to live both during the day and night its obvious that the game will get a bit more difficult. But at the same time you got some really nice weapons to help you out.\n\nItachi (Zombie Pigman) : Strong\nB Class Enemy Ninjas (Skeleton) : Some type of ninja which uses chakra skills on you\nKonan (Stray) : Uses chakra skills on you\nKisame (Wither Skeleton) : Wields a sword\nZetsu Clone (Husk) : Very dangerous mob, deals a lot of damage\nA Class Enemy Shinobi (Zombie) : Found both during the day and night, dangerous\nS Class Enemy Shinobi (Zombie Villager) : More rare than the above, but they are also the strongest of all ninjas/shinobis\n\nArmor\nThe armor sets are replaced with a few different Naruto armors (or clothing). The armor sets dont have any special abilities yet (due to addon limitations).\n\nJounin Armor (Diamond Armor)\nAkatasuki Clothing (Gold Armor)\nNarutos Jacket and Clothes (Iron Armor)",

"description": "The addon implements six of the alien robots which are most known from the Transformers movie franchise. The robots have incredible powers which allow them to do things such as transforming into different vehicles. There are two different alliances known as the Autobots (friendly) and the Decepticons (hostile) and they have each very different behaviors.\n\nOptimus Prime is a skillful fighter who possess good military tactics and advanced alien technologies. He is considered the leader of the Autobots which is one of the factions in Transformers.\n\nBumblebee is one of the bravest and most trusted lieutenants among Optimus Primes troops. He might not be the strongest, but his hate for the Decepticons is strong and that makes him a powerful warrior in combat. Similar to the other Autobots hes friendly towards players.\n\nGrimlock is a Dinobot which instead of transforming into vehicles transforms into huge dinosaurs. The Dinobots is a subfaction of the Autobots (meaning, the friendly ones) and that means that they fight on the same side as the Autobots (e.g. Optimus Prime and so on).\n\nDecepticons\nBlackout is an extremely dangerous Transformer which will hunt down his enemies and kill them with no mercy. Hes very fast and spawns mostly everywhere since he replaces the creeper.\n\nShockwave is an evil Decepticon which is under the command of “Megatron”. Its by default hostile towards players and will attack them by shooting large fireballs. At this point it cant transform into anything but thats likely to happen for a future update.\n\nStarscream is one of the strongest Decepticons and his own wish is to some day replace “Megatron”. This transformer is extremely dangerous and will attack players. It wont attack anything for as long as its transformed into a jet but thats hopefully going to be fixed in a future update.\n\nOther Features\n\nCustom sounds for mobs\n\nAll emeralds items and blocks have been replaced by Energon which will work as a healing material in an upcoming version\n\nBow, arrows and snowballs are alien-human weapon prototypes",

"description": "PokeCraft is a promising Pokémon mod which is exclusively being created for Minecraft Pocket Edition. This version is an early beta and includes features such as 20+ Pokémon, catch and release system and randomly generated structures. If you want to turn your Minecraft world into the universe of Pokémon then you need to give this one a try.\nGetting Started\nBefore getting started we highly recommend to download and use one of the Pokémon player skins to really make it look as if you were playing a Pokémon game.\nThere are currently more than 20 different Pokémon and they spawn naturally in different biomes throughout the world.\nThere features still quite limited at the moment. Right now you can only catch and spawn Pokémon.\n\nTo catch one begin by getting a poke ball from the creative inventory. Find a Pokémon which you want to catch then long press on the screen to through the poke ball and attempt the catch.\n\nThe catch rate is random and sometimes you are unlucky and have to redo it. In this case, I successfully managed to catch my Pokémon which was an Ivysaur. Dont forget to the pick up the poke ball.\nYou can catch up to 6 different Pokémon. The mod is using a slot system which can be accessed by the text chat.\n\nType any of the following commands in the text chat to manage your Pokémons:\n\nr = Release / Return Pokémon\ns0-5 (e.g. s1) = Select active slot\nd0-5 (e.g. d3) = Deletes the Pokémon in that slot\nIn the future you can expect a more slick user interface for this.\n\nAnyways, to summon a caught Pokémon type r in the chat.\nItem IDs\nThere are many more items than the ones listed here. However, since this is a beta version most of them have no features. Down below you will only find items which can be used in-game. For now, none of the items have crafting recipes.\n\nDelete Pokemon (2003)\nPoke Ball (1000)\nMaster Ball (1001)\nUltra Ball (1002)\nGreat Ball (1003)\nSafari Ball (1004)\nNet Ball (1005)\nLure Ball (1006)\nLevel Ball (1007)\nDive Ball (1008)\nMoon Ball (1009)\nNest Ball (1010)\nDusk Ball (1011)\nHeal Ball (1012)\nQuick Ball (1013)\nRepeat Ball (1014)\nTimer Ball (1015)\nLuxury Ball (1016)\nPremier Ball (1017)\nFast Ball (1018)\nFriend Ball (1019)\nCherish Ball (1020)\nLove Ball (1021)\nPark Ball (1022)\nSport Ball (1023)\nHeavy Ball (1024)",

Press the jump button to get off and stop riding it.\nChocobo Pen\nBuild a pen for your chocobos to allow them someplace to rest and gain back their health. For a structure to be considered a pen it requires a roof and a floor of straw.\n\nTo find out health and other important information about your pet tap on it using a Chocopedia.\nBreeding\nTo breed two chocobos you will need two Loverly Gysahls (crafting recipes), one male and one female tamed Chocobo. (Use a Chocopedia to find out their sex.) Take them to a pen and then give them one Loverly Gysahl each.\nSoon after they will procreate and drop an egg on the ground.

"description": " It has always been a little strange having the Moon rise over this build, so this resource pack will fix that. The resource pack replaces the Moon texture image with an image of Earth which helps give the entire build more realism.\nIt’s clearly mainly just going to look good on builds where you’re trying to emulate a moon environment.\n\nChangelog\n\nBetter quality / higher resolution of the Earth\nAlso features the Earth rising into Minecraft’s daylight cycle\n",

The village is quite small but has been nicely generated at a little hillside. In the blacksmith in the village you will find a chest with actually some quite nice things in the chest. To get to the two remaining villages simply walk the other way from where you spawned and you will after a while see the villages. Both of the villages are situated in a quite dramatic and differentiating terrain. For example, theres one lake with an island covered in flowers. And then a little further ahead there is a big savannah mountain. The second village also got a blacksmith and in the chest you will find the following items The third and last village is located in the savannah biome and got good resources in the blacksmith chest as well.\n",
